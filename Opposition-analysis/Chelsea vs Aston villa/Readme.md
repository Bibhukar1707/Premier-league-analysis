# Opposition Analysis — Pre-Match Framework

This section of the portfolio focuses on **pre-match opposition analysis**, representing a progression from descriptive post-match reporting to predictive, decision-support analytics.

The objective is to demonstrate not only analytical outcomes, but the **process, structure, and judgement** behind them.

---

## Analytical Scope

Each opposition analysis is built using:
- The last five relevant matches
- Strict home vs away contextualisation
- Publicly available FBref data

The emphasis is placed on **stable, repeatable metrics** rather than fragile or over-detailed indicators.

---

## Key Metrics Used

- Possession proxy (passes attempted)
- Shot volume (for and against)
- Expected goals (xG)
- Shot distance profiles
- Shot timing tendencies
- Goalkeeper workload

Passing style and pass type metrics are intentionally excluded to prioritise reliability and clarity.

---

## Workflow

1. Raw data collection (FBref CSV exports)
2. Python-based cleaning and aggregation
3. Multi-match trend analysis
4. Pre-match expectation logging
5. Post-match validation (added after full-time)

This workflow mirrors real-world analytical processes used under matchday time constraints.

## Portfolio Progression

- **Post-Match Analysis (Parts A & B):**  
  Focused on describing what happened

- **Opposition Analysis (Part C):**  
  Focused on predicting what is likely to happen and why

This progression highlights growth in:
- Analytical thinking
- Scope management
- Decision support orientation

---

## Validation & Accountability

Each pre-match analysis includes explicitly logged expectations.

After the match, these expectations are reviewed in a post-match validation report, allowing for:
- Honest assessment
- Learning feedback loops
- Continuous improvement

---

## Development Philosophy

This portfolio prioritises:
- Accuracy over complexity
- Structure over speculation
- Reproducibility over presentation

The goal is to demonstrate readiness for professional performance and opposition analysis environments.
