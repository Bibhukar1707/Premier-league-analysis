# Newcastle United vs Chelsea — Match Analysis

This project represents the **third completed match analysis** within an evolving Premier League performance analysis portfolio.

It builds directly on the analytical frameworks established in the previous two matches, while introducing additional contextual layers and improved presentation through Power BI.

## Portfolio Progression Context

This match analysis follows a structured progression:

- **Match 1: Chelsea vs Everton**
  - Baseline team metrics
  - Shot volume, xG, shot distance
  - Initial Python and Power BI workflow

- **Match 2: Manchester United vs Bournemouth**
  - Shot outcome breakdown
  - Time-based shot analysis
  - Improved dashboard structure

- **Match 3: Newcastle United vs Chelsea (This Project)**
  - Maintains all prior analytical layers
  - Introduces goalkeeper context
  - Integrates match dynamics more clearly
  - Demonstrates responsible handling of passing data through qualitative context
  - Improves visual communication using Power BI exports and external reference visuals

## Key Analytical Themes

This analysis focuses on:
- Team-level shot production and expected goals
- Shot outcome distributions
- Shot distance profiles
- Match dynamics across phases
- Goalkeeper involvement
- Qualitative passing context

Passing data is intentionally treated qualitatively due to structural limitations in publicly available match-level passing data. This reflects a deliberate emphasis on analytical accuracy over forced numerical outputs.
