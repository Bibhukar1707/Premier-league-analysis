# Aston Villa vs Manchester United — Match Analysis

This project represents the next stage of development within a structured Premier League performance analysis portfolio.

The analytical framework remains consistent with earlier matches, allowing comparison across games while highlighting clear methodological progression.

---

## Portfolio Progression

- **Match 1: Chelsea vs Everton**  
  Baseline shot volume, xG, and shot distance analysis

- **Match 2: Manchester United vs Bournemouth**  
  Shot outcome breakdown and match-phase dynamics

- **Match 3: Newcastle United vs Chelsea**  
  Goalkeeper context and qualitative passing analysis

- **Match 4: Aston Villa vs Manchester United (This Project)**  
  - Numeric passing style analysis (short / medium / long)
  - Clean separation between passing volume and pass types
  - Chronologically correct match timing analysis
  - Improved pipeline reliability and reduced error handling

---

## Analytical Focus

This analysis examines:
- Shot volume vs chance quality
- Shot outcomes and distance profiles
- Match flow across defined time windows
- Ball progression through passing styles
- Defensive context via goalkeeper actions

Public data limitations are handled deliberately, prioritising clarity and accuracy over over-interpretation.

---

## Tools & Workflow

- **Data Source:** FBref
- **Data Processing:** Python (Pandas)
- **Visualisation:** Power BI
- **Reporting:** GitHub Markdown

All outputs are reproducible using the included Python script.
