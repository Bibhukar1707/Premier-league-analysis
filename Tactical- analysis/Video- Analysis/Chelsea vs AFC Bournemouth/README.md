Chelsea vs AFC Bournemouth
Build-Up Analysis vs High Press

Premier League | 30 December 2025

1. Match Context

Team Analysed: Chelsea

Opposition: AFC Bournemouth

Competition: Premier League

Match Date: 30 December 2025

2. Tactical Objective

To analyse Chelsea’s build-up structure and progression against Bournemouth’s aggressive high-pressing defensive organisation, and to evaluate how Chelsea adapted across both halves.

3. Tactical Context (First-Watch Summary)

Chelsea initially attempted to construct play using a back four structure, with both centre backs forming the first line of build-up. Progression support was primarily offered by Caicedo, with occasional fullback involvement to create a temporary double pivot.

Bournemouth adopted a consistently high and aggressive pressing approach, often engaging the goalkeeper directly and prioritising central access denial. This pressing strategy had a significant influence on Chelsea’s build-up decisions and outcomes.

4. Tactical Patterns Identified (Phase 4 Analysis)
Pattern 1 — Chelsea’s Initial Build-Up Structure

Chelsea predominantly built from a back four, with centre backs splitting to the edges of the penalty area. Under pressure, this structure frequently adapted into a temporary back three, achieved through either:

Caicedo dropping between centre backs, or

The goalkeeper stepping outside the penalty area to attract the first line of press.

Despite these adaptations, Chelsea struggled to establish stable central progression during the first half.

Evidence:
Clips 3, 8, 11, 14, 16

Pattern 2 — Bournemouth’s High Press & Central Denial

Bournemouth pressed high and aggressively throughout the first half, often engaging Chelsea’s goalkeeper and man-marking Caicedo to restrict access through the central pivot.

This approach successfully disrupted Chelsea’s preferred build-up routes, forcing:

Early long distributions

Reduced build-up patience

Reliance on second balls rather than controlled progression

Evidence:
Clips 6, 9, 11, 13, 16

Pattern 3 — Forced Long Distribution & Second-Ball Focus

As a consequence of Bournemouth’s press, Chelsea were repeatedly forced into long goal kicks and long passes under pressure, even when short options were structurally available.

While Chelsea occasionally won second balls—often aided by inverted fullback positioning—Bournemouth were generally effective at:

Contesting aerial duels

Winning second balls

Sustaining territorial pressure

This significantly limited Chelsea’s ability to build sustained possession in the first half.

Evidence:
Clips 1, 5, 9, 10, 13

Pattern 4 — Situational Success Through Fullback Inversion

On select occasions, Chelsea successfully broke Bournemouth’s first pressing line when a fullback inverted early to support midfield circulation. These moments created:

Central overloads

Passing lanes behind Bournemouth’s first line

Cleaner progression into midfield

However, these behaviours were inconsistent and not systematically repeated in the first half.

Evidence:
Clips 2, 12, 15

5. Second-Half Adjustments & Impact

Following halftime substitutions, Chelsea displayed improved structural integrity and composure during build-up.

Key adjustments observed:

More consistent involvement of the defensive midfielder higher up the pitch

Earlier and more deliberate fullback inversion

Reduced frequency of immediate long distributions

Improved circulation speed through central areas

These changes reduced the effectiveness of Bournemouth’s press and allowed Chelsea to progress with greater control, although the improvement remained partial rather than dominant.

Evidence:
Second-Half Clips 2, 3, 4

6. Coaching Implications

Develop clearer solutions when the single pivot is man-marked during build-up

Improve coordination between goalkeeper decision-making and central support options

Reinforce systematic fullback inversion to create central overloads against high presses

Strengthen second-ball structure when long distribution is unavoidable

Encourage quicker third-man combinations to bypass aggressive first-line pressure

7. Final Summary

Chelsea attempted to build primarily from a back four against Bournemouth’s aggressive high press. Bournemouth’s man-oriented approach and central denial consistently disrupted Chelsea’s build-up, forcing frequent long distributions and reliance on second balls. While Chelsea adapted through temporary back threes and goalkeeper involvement, these solutions lacked consistency in the first half. Second-half personnel and structural adjustments improved Chelsea’s control and reduced Bournemouth’s pressing efficiency, but only partially resolved the build-up challenges.
