# Chelsea vs Everton — Tactical & Performance Analysis
This project represents the **first full match analysis** in an ongoing Premier League performance analysis portfolio.

The objective of this work is not only to analyse individual matches, but to **build a structured, repeatable analytical process** that evolves in complexity and depth over time — mirroring how professional analysts develop within elite football environments.

This analysis is conducted from two primary perspectives:

- **Tactical Analyst** — understanding team structures, phases of play, and in-game adjustments
- **Opposition Analyst** — identifying tendencies, strengths, and vulnerabilities relevant to match preparation

This project uses **publicly available data** combined with qualitative match observation.

- FBref (event-level and summary statistics)

**Tools**
- Python (data cleaning, aggregation, and visual generation)
- Power BI (dashboarding and visual communication)
- GitHub (version control and portfolio presentation)

This initial analysis focuses on establishing **core analytical foundations**, including:

- Shot volume and shot quality (xG)
- Shot outcome breakdowns
- Distance-based shot analysis
- Team-level performance summaries

The emphasis at this stage is on **clarity, correctness, and process**, rather than advanced modelling.

This repository is intentionally designed to show **progression over time**.

Future iterations of this work will introduce:
- More granular tactical metrics
- Automated data pipelines
- Enhanced visual storytelling
- Cross-match and season-level comparisons
- More advanced contextual and situational analysis

This allows reviewers to assess not only the current output, but the **rate and direction of improvement**.
